# Marvel Mods GIMP Plugins
by BaconWizard17
## Scale MUA1 Previews
This plugin scales MUA1 preview images to 543x1080 to fit the skin showcase templates.

### Compatibility
This script will only work correctly on mannequin and skin previews that have been cropped by my scripts for cropping MUA1 skin and mannequin previews. This should not be used on conversation portraits (HUDs).

### Installation
 1. This script can be installed using `runUpdateAdmin.bat` from my scripts, or it can be placed individually in your GIMP plugins directory. The standard location for this is `C:\Users\(your user)\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\2.10\plug-ins`. Check the main `README.md` file in this project for more details on proper installation.

### Usage
1. Start with an image open in GIMP that you would like to scale. See the "Compatibility" section above for details on the image type.
2. In the toolbar, go to `Marvel Mods/Skin Previews/Crop Screenshots - MUA1` and choose the `Scale Previews` plugin.
3. The image will be scaled to the correct size.
