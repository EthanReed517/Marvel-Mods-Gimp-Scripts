# Marvel Mods GIMP Plugins

## Crop MUA1 Skin Preview
This plugin crops a screenshot from MUA1 PC to create a preview of a conversation portrait (HUD).

### Compatibility
This script will only work correctly if the resolution is set to 1920x1080. The screenshot must be taken in the character select screen while viewing the character details. I generally take my screenshots with the character in the second slot while viewing their skins. I use the original (v1.0-1.5) 36 Roster Hack team stage as the background

### Installation
 1. This script can be installed using `update.bat` from the main folder of this release, or it can be placed individually in your GIMP plugins directory. The standard location for this is `C:\Users\(your user)\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\2.10\plug-ins`. Check the main `README.md` file in this project for more details on proper installation.

### Usage
1. Start with an image open in GIMP that you would like to crop. See the "Compatibility" section above for details on the image type.
2. In the toolbar, go to `Marvel Mods/Skin Previews/Crop Screenshots - MUA1` and choose the `Crop Skin Preview` plugin.
3. The image will be cropped to the correct size.
