# Marvel Mods GIMP Plugins
by BaconWizard17
## Create a Showcase for Multiple Skin Previews
This plugin creates a template with grids to showcase multiple skins.

### Compatibility
This script is designed to support the standard 543x1080 preview images created by my other skin preview cropping/scaling scripts. I generally use this to compile several single skin showcases.

### Installation
 1. This script can be installed using `update.bat` from the main folder of this release, or it can be placed individually in your GIMP plugins directory. The standard location for this is `C:\Users\(your user)\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\2.10\plug-ins`. Check the main `README.md` file in this project for more details on proper installation.

### Usage
1. Start with an image open in GIMP that you would like to crop. See the "Compatibility" section above for details on the image type.
2. In the toolbar, go to `Marvel Mods/Skin Previews/Skin Showcase` and choose the `Create Multi Skin Preview` plugin.
3. A dialog box will appear. It will include sliders for the number of rows and columns. Pick the number of rows and columns from 1 to 8.
4. Press OK. The new image will be created.
5. You can now copy previews into the image and align them how you like.
