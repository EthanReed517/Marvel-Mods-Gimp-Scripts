# Marvel Mods GIMP Plugins

## Create a Showcase for Multiple Skin Previews
This plugin creates a template with grids to showcase a single skin with all its assets.

### Compatibility
This script is designed to support the standard 543x1080 preview images created by my other skin preview cropping/scaling scripts. I generally use this to compile the various assets that are included with a skin. I generally create this with 2 previews. The left preview window contains the main skin with the main conversation portrait in the top left grid spot. For XML2 skins, I will include the 3D head preview in the top middle or lower left grid spot (depending on the height of the character) and the character select portrait in the top right grid spot. The right preview generally contains mannequins for MUA1 or the skin without cel shading for XML2. If the character has alternate skins included (such as an NPC variation), I will create 3 or 4 previews based on the need

### Installation
 1. This script can be installed using `runUpdateAdmin.bat` from my scripts, or it can be placed individually in your GIMP plugins directory. The standard location for this is `C:\Users\(your user)\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\2.10\plug-ins`. Check the main `README.md` file in this project for more details on proper installation.

### Usage
1. Start with an image open in GIMP that you would like to crop. See the "Compatibility" section above for details on the image type.
2. In the toolbar, go to `Marvel Mods/Skin Previews/Skin Showcase` and choose the `Create Single Skin Preview` plugin.
3. A dialog box will appear. It will include sliders for the number of rows and columns. Pick the number of rows and columns from 1 to 8.
3. Press OK. The new image will be created.
5. You can now copy previews into the image and align them how you like.
