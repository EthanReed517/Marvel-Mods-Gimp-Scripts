# Marvel Mods GIMP Plugins

## Crop XML2 3D Head Preview
This plugin crops a screenshot from XML2 PC to create a preview of a 3D head.

### Compatibility
This script will only work correctly if the resolution is set to 1920x1080. The screenshot must be taken during normal gameplay while only one character is on the team. Any part of the head that protrudes beyond the circle will be cut out, so certain portraits may need to be cropped manually.

### Installation
 1. This script can be installed using `update.bat` from the main folder of this release, or it can be placed individually in your GIMP plugins directory. The standard location for this is `C:\Users\(your user)\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\2.10\plug-ins`. Check the main `README.md` file in this project for more details on proper installation.

### Usage
1. Start with an image open in GIMP that you would like to crop. See the "Compatibility" section above for details on the image type.
2. In the toolbar, go to `Marvel Mods/Skin Previews/Crop Screenshots - XML2` and choose the `Crop 3D Head Preview` plugin.
3. The image will be cropped to the correct size.
