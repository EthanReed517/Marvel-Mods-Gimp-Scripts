# Marvel Mods GIMP Plugins
by BaconWizard17
## Crop MUA1 Mannequin Preview
This plugin crops a screenshot from XML2 PC to create a preview of a character select portrait (CSP).

### Compatibility
This script will only work correctly if the resolution is set to 1920x1080. The screenshot must be taken in the character select screen while selecting a character and while hovering over the portrait in question. 

### Installation
 1. This script can be installed using `runUpdateAdmin.bat` from my scripts, or it can be placed individually in your GIMP plugins directory. The standard location for this is `C:\Users\(your user)\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\2.10\plug-ins`. Check the main `README.md` file in this project for more details on proper installation.

### Usage
1. Start with an image open in GIMP that you would like to crop. See the "Compatibility" section above for details on the image type.
2. In the toolbar, go to `Marvel Mods/Skin Previews/Crop Screenshots - XML2` and choose the `Crop Character Select Portrait Preview` plugin.
3. The image will be cropped to the correct size.
