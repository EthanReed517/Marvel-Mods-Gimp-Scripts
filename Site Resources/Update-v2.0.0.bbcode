The Marvel Mods GIMP Scripts have been updated to version 2.0.0 with the following updates:
[list]
[li]Redesigned all scripts so that all common processes are handled in an external process, greatly increasing processing speed.[/li]
[li]Added export scripts for power icons, comic covers, loading screens, concept art, and map models.[/li]
[li]Added support for indexed-alpha textures using pngquant.[/li]
[li]Changed processing for environment maps to use plain png textures instead of dds textures because 3ds Max 5 doesn't support dds environment maps.[/li]
[li]Added a script that crops and exports game screenshots based on layer names.[/li]
