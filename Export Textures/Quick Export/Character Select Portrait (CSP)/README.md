## Quick Export - Export Character Select Portrait (CSP)
This is a quick version of my `Export Character Select Portrait (CSP)` plugin that runs without a dialog and uses my preferred settings. This plugin exports a skin texture in several optimized formats. For more information on compatibility, usage, and templates, see the main script.

The following values are selected:
 - **Console**: `All`
	- **Export a CSP for XML1?**: `No`
	- **Export a CSP for XML2?**: `Yes`
For more information on these settings, see the "Export Character Select Portrait (CSP)" plugin. 

This plugin contains all functionality of the full version, so the hard-coded settings can be changed by editing the `.py` file.

### Installation
 1. This script can be installed using `update.bat` from the main folder of this release. Check the main `README.md` file in this project for more details on proper installation.
