## Quick Export - Export Conversation Portrait (HUD)
This is a quick version of my `Export Conversation Portrait (HUD)` plugin that runs without a dialog and uses my preferred settings. This plugin exports a skin texture in several optimized formats. For more information on compatibility, usage, and templates, see the main script.

The following values are selected:
 - **Console**: `All`
 - **Export a Plain Portrait?**: `No`
 - **Export an MUA1 next-gen style portrait?**: `Yes`
 - **Export a portrait with a hero outline?**: `Yes`
 - **Export a portrait with a red villain outline?**: `No`
 - **Export a portrait with a green villain outline?**: `No`
 - **Alchemy Version**: `Alchemy 2.5`
For more information on these settings, see the "Export Conversation Portrait (HUD)" plugin. 

This plugin contains all functionality of the full version, so the hard-coded settings can be changed by editing the `.py` file.

### Installation
 1. This script can be installed using `update.bat` from the main folder of this release. Check the main `README.md` file in this project for more details on proper installation.
