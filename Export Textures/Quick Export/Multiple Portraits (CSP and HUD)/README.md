## Quick Export - Export Multiple Portraits (CSP and HUD)
This is a quick version of my `Export Multiple Portraits (CSP and HUD)` plugin that runs without a dialog and uses my preferred settings. This plugin exports a multiple CSP and HUD textures. For more information on compatibility, usage, and templates, see the main script.

The following values are selected:
 - **Alchemy Version**: `Alchemy 2.5`
 - **Export a Plain HUD?**: `No`
 - **Export an MUA1 next-gen style HUD?**: `Yes`
 - **Export a HUD with a hero outline?**: `Yes`
 - **Export a HUD with a red villain outline?**: `No`
 - **Export a HUD with a green villain outline?**: `No`
 - **Export a CSP for XML1?**: `Yes`
 - **Export a CSP for XML2?**: `Yes`
4. If the file is not set up properly, you will receive an error with explanations. Otherwise, it will move on.
For more information on these settings, see the "Export Multiple Portraits (CSP and HUD)" plugin. 

This plugin contains all functionality of the full version, so the hard-coded settings can be changed by editing the `.py` file.

### Installation
1. This script can be installed using `update.bat` from the main folder of this release. Check the main `README.md` file in this project for more details on proper installation.
