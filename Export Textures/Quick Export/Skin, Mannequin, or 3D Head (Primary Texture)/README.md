## Quick Export - Export Skin, Mannequin, or 3D Head (Primary Texture)
This is a quick version of my `Export Skin, Mannequin, or 3D Head (Primary Texture)` plugin that runs without a dialog and uses my preferred settings. This plugin exports a skin texture in several optimized formats. For more information on compatibility and usage, see the main script.

The following values are selected:
 - **Console**: `All`
 - **Skin Type**: `Primary`
 - **Character Size**: `Standard`
 - **Alchemy Version**: `Alchemy 2.5`
 - **Transparency**: `No`
 - **PSP Texture Compression**: `PNG8` 
For more information on these settings, see the "Export Skin, Mannequin, or 3D Head (Primary Texture)" plugin. 

This plugin contains all functionality of the full version, so the hard-coded settings can be changed by editing the `.py` file.

### Installation
 1. This script can be installed using `update.bat` from the main folder of this release. Check the main `README.md` file in this project for more details on proper installation.
