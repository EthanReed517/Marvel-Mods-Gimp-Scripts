## Quick Export 3D Asset - Diffuse Texture
This is a quick version of my `Export 3D Asset - Diffuse Texture` plugin that runs without a dialog and uses my preferred settings. This plugin exports a texture for a 3D asset (skin, mannequin, 3D head, bolton, power model, or map model). For more information on compatibility and usage, see the main script.

The following settings are set as the default:
 - **Export Method**: `3ds Max`
 - **Transparency**: `No`
For more information on these settings, see the "Export 3D Asset - Diffuse Texture" plugin. 

This plugin contains all functionality of the full version, so the hard-coded settings can be changed by editing the `.py` file.

### Installation
1. This script can be installed using `update.bat` from the main folder of this release. Check the main `README.md` file in this project for more details on proper installation.
