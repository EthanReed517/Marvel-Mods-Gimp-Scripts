# Marvel Mods GIMP Plugins
by BaconWizard17

## Export Conversation Portrait (HUD)
This plugin exports a conversation portrait (HUD) texture.

### Compatibility
This script will only work correctly if the image has been saved as a .xcf file. The texture should be square. My templates are recommended for use, as they contain the correct layer names. See the "Templates" section for more information. The portrait should not have any outline, as this will be generated by the script. The file name does not need to include `_conversation` at the end; if this is not present, the script will add it automatically. It's only necessary to use the character number in the file name.

### Installation
1. This script can be installed using `update.bat` from the main folder of this release. Check the main `README.md` file in this project for more details on proper installation.

### Usage
1. Start with an image open in GIMP that you would like to export. See the "Compatibility" section above for details on the image type.
2. In the toolbar, go to `Marvel Mods/Export Textures/By Asset Type` and choose the `Export Conversation Portrait (HUD)` plugin.
3. You will be presented with a series of options:
	- **Alchemy Version**: Select which version of Alchemy you're using. `Alchemy 2.5` will export the textures to be set up in 3ds Max 5 with the Alchemy 2.5 plugin. `Alchemy 5` will export the textures to be set up in 3ds Max 10-12 with the Alchemy 5 plugin. `Alchemy 5 (Texture Replacement)` will export the textures in .tga format to use with the Alchemy 5 texture creation tools.
	- **Export a Plain Portrait?**: Select if you want to export a plain portrait with no outline.
	- **Export an MUA1 next-gen style portrait?**: Select if you want to export a portrait in the style of next-gen MUA1 (transparent background and no frame)
	- **Export a portrait with a hero outline?**: Select if you want to export a portrait with a typical blue outline.
	- **Export a portrait with a red villain outline?**: Select if you want to export a portrait with a red outline, denoting that they are a villain.
	- **Export a portrait with a green villain outline?**: Select if you want to export a portrait with a green outline, denoting that they are possessed by Doctor Doom.
4. If the file is not set up properly, you will receive an error with explanations. Otherwise, it will move on.
5. The .xcf will be saved and several additional operations will be run while the texture is being exported. A single plain .png texture will be exported for each game.
6. This script creates duplicate images to export, so you will not see any changes on your texture. Wait for the status bar to finish before proceeding with any further operations to your texture. Once it's done running, a message will announce that the export is complete.

## Templates
In order for the script to function correctly, I've provided three templates that can be used with it: `Template (64x64).xcf`, `Template (128x128).xcf`, and `Template (256x256).xcf`. The only difference between each is the texture size. Here's how to use the templates:
1. Open the template that you want to use in GIMP. Save it as something else so that you always have the templates available. The file name doesn't matter.
2. The layer with an example images in them (90s Cyclops) can be cleared out, but keep the layers themselves so that you can have the correct names.
3. Copy the character's portrait into the layer called "Character." Orient it however you want. The guides can be used as a reference.
    - The top horizontal guide is where I usually have the character's eyes.
	- The bottom horizontal guide is where I usually have the character's chin.
	- The vertical guide is the center line.
4. There should be 3 layers:
    - **Frame**: The top layer that is all black on the edges with a circular cutout in the middle.
	- **Character**: The character's portrait.
	- **Background**: The background image. By default, this is the diamond plate pattern used by MUA1 portraits.
