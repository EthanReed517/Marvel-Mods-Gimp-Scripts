## Scale Image to Half Its Original Size
This plugin reduces the size of an image to half its original dimensions. 

### Compatibility
Any image in GIMP.

### Installation
 1. This script can be installed using `runUpdateAdmin.bat` from my scripts, or it can be placed individually in your GIMP plugins directory. The standard location for this is `C:\Users\(your user)\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\2.10\plug-ins`. Check the main `README.md` file in this project for more details on proper installation.

### Usage
1. Start with an image open in GIMP that you would like to reduce in size.
2. In the toolbar, go to `Marvel Mods/Image Scaling` and choose the `Scale to Half Size` plugin.
3. The image will be scaled to its new size.
