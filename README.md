# Marvel Mods GIMP Plugins
by BaconWizard17
## General Information
These plugins can be used with GIMP to perform a variety of functions. These are designed for different modding processes used by myself and others at [MarvelMods.com](https://marvelmods.com/forum/index.php), but they can be used for other things as well.

### Compatibility
GIMP (primarily verified with GIMP 2.10)

### Prerequisites
You must have [gegl-python-fu & gegl_graph Ver.3.0.zip](http://gimpchat.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=20613&start=80#p285476) by MareroQ installed in your GIMP plug-ins folder (usually `C:\Users\(your user)\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\2.10\plug-ins`) for certain scripts to function.
You must have [pngquant.exe](https://pngquant.org) (choose the "Binary for Windows" option) installed in `C:\Windows` for certain scripts to function.

### Installation
 1. Open `update.bat` with Notepad++ or another text editor.
 2. Edit the file paths in line 6 and line 8 to reflect your GIMP configuration.
 3. Save `update.bat`
 4. Run `update.bat` as an administrator, which will allow you to access the necessary folders.

Alternatively, you can manually paste individual scripts into the appropriate folders.

### Usage
1. In the toolbar, go to `Marvel Mods` to find the plugins. 
2. Each plugin has more detailed information in its own `README.md` file, which is included within this archive.
