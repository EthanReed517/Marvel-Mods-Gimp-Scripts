# Marvel Mods GIMP Plugins
by BaconWizard17
## General Information
These plugins can be used with GIMP to perform a variety of functions. These are designed for different modding processes used by myself and others at [MarvelMods.com](https://marvelmods.com/forum/index.php), but they can be used for other things as well.

### Compatibility
GIMP (primarily verified with GIMP 2.10)

### Installation
 1. Open `update.bat` with Notepad++ or another text editor.
 2. Edit the file paths in lines 6 and 8 to reflect your GIMP configuration.
 3. Save `update.bat`
 4. Run `runUpdateAdmin.bat` to run the update script with administrator access, which will allow you to access the necessary folders.

Alternatively, you can manually paste individual scripts into the appropriate folders.

### Usage
1. In the toolbar, go to `Marvel Mods` for Python scripts or `Marvel Mods (Legacy)` for Scheme plugins. Certain plugins are repeated in both places while they're being updated.
2. Each plugin has more detailed information in its own `README.md` file, which is included within this archive.
