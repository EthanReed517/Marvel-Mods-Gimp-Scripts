## RGB-BGR Swap Image
This plugin switches the red and blue channels of the image with the option to flatten the image beforehand.

### Compatibility
Any image in GIMP, ideally one that is ready to be exported. 

### Installation
 1. This script can be installed using `update.bat` from the main folder of this release, or it can be placed individually in your GIMP plugins directory. The standard location for this is `C:\Users\(your user)\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\2.10\plug-ins`. Check the main `README.md` file in this project for more details on proper installation.

### Usage
1. Start with an image open in GIMP that you would like to RGB-BGR swap.
2. In the toolbar, go to `Marvel Mods/Utilities` and choose the `RGB-BGR Swap` plugin.
3. A dialog box will appear, asking if you want to flatten the image. Make a selection and press "OK"
4. THe image will be flattened if that was selected, and then the red and blue channels will be swapped. This can all be undone with a single press of Ctrl+Z.
5. The image can now be exported as a dds file.
