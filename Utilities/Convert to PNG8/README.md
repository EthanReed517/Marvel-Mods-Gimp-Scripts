This plugin flattens the image and converts to an indexed palette with 256 colors.

### Compatibility

### Installation
 1. This script can be installed using `update.bat` from the main folder of this release, or it can be placed individually in your GIMP plugins directory. The standard location for this is `C:\Users\(your user)\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\2.10\plug-ins`. Check the main `README.md` file in this project for more details on proper installation.

### Usage

2. In the toolbar, go to `Marvel Mods/Utilities` and choose the `Convert to PNG8` plugin.
3. The image will be flattened and reduced to 256 colors. This can all be undone with a single press of Ctrl+Z.
4. The image can now be exported as a png file.
