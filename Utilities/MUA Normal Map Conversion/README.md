## MUA Normal Map Conversion
This plugin converts a red/blue normal map to a green/alpha normal map automatically.

### Compatibility
Typical red/blue normal maps. 

### Installation
 1. This script can be installed using `update.bat` from the main folder of this release, or it can be placed individually in your GIMP scripts directory. The batch file should be run as an administrator. The standard location for this is `C:\Program Files\GIMP 2\share\gimp\2.0\scripts`. Check the main `README.md` file in this project for more details on proper installation.

### Usage
1. Start with an image open in GIMP that you would like to convert to convert to a green normal map.
2. In the toolbar, go to `Marvel Mods/Utilities` and choose the `MUA Normal Map Conversion` plugin.
3. Several operations will run on the image, and then a new layer will be created with the green normal map. The normal map is now ready to be exported.
