# Marvel Mods GIMP Plugins
by BaconWizard17
## Flatten Image
This plugin flattens the image.

### Compatibility
Any image in GIMP, ideally one that is ready to be exported. 

### Installation
 1. This script can be installed using `runUpdateAdmin.bat` from my scripts, or it can be placed individually in your GIMP plugins directory. The standard location for this is `C:\Users\(your user)\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\2.10\plug-ins`. Check the main `README.md` file in this project for more details on proper installation.

### Usage
1. Start with an image open in GIMP that you would like to convert to PNG4.
2. In the toolbar, go to `Marvel Mods/Utilities` and choose the `Flatten Image` plugin.
3. The image will be flattened. This can all be undone with a single press of Ctrl+Z.
4. The image can now be exported as a dds file.
