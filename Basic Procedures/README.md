# Marvel Mods GIMP Plugins
by BaconWizard17
## Basic Procedures
This is a series of procedures that are common to many other operations. Although they can be used on their own, they are primarily meant to be used within other scripts. They don't contain readme files because they are not meant for individual use, but they do have brief descriptions in their file.

### Installation
 1. This script can be installed using `runUpdateAdmin.bat` from my scripts, or it can be placed individually in your GIMP plugins directory. The standard location for this is `C:\Users\(your user)\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\2.10\plug-ins`. Check the main `README.md` file in this project for more details on proper installation.
